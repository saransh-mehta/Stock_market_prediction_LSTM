# Stock_market_prediction_LSTM
RNN's can also be used to predict values in share market rather than the conventional algorithms of Regressions, SVM's etc.
This project has a LSTM model created and trained on data of various Stocks like Yahoo, ZTS, GM etc.
The model is taking input in a sequence of 10  values and ouputs the next ten possible values.
Although, the validation accuracy of the model is low, but this type of application of Deep learning in stock market has great potential.
